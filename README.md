# HAMBURGER ICONS
A small library of 5 cool hamburger icon effects written in SASS with a little help of vanilla JS.

## USAGE
Include the hamb.css file in the CSS folder or the hamb.scss file in the SCSS folder to your project. Use the HTML markup and correspondent icon classes from the hamb.html file. That's it!
